# getaround

Minimal (but still opinionated) aliases/functions to make ssh sessions on a new
server a little more pleasant.

Vanilla bash is nice and all, but my muscle memory wants to do some things in a
certain way.

Vim configuration is kept to a bare minimum - the ulterior motive of
`getaround` is to learn to use vanilla vim without all them plugins :)

## usage

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/goude/getaround  # do _not_ start hearing the Beach Boys
$ source getaround/getaround.sh
$ getaround
```
